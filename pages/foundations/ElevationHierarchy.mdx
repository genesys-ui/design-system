# Elevation hierarchy

It’s used to bring the content closer or further to the user.

Elevation marks the distance of elements from the background and arranges them along the z-axis. To do this,
each elevation level is defined by a specific shadow that simulates the way in which natural light is projected on
objects depending on the distance to them.

The different elevation levels available correspond to the different levels of importance with which we want to organize
the components throughout the UI.

Elevation levels with higher numbers are usually visually closer to the user and have typically larger
and more spread shadow.

## Ground (level 0)

This level is used for the background, cases where you want to lower content that isn’t so important or draw attention
to components that should have better visibility on a depressed background. It's used for App/Dashboard background.

## Raised (level 1)

This level is used to position those components that act as containers for others on the Ground. The most representative
are the Panels, Widgets, etc.

## Sticky (level 1.5)

This level is applied only to elements that are fixed in position at the top or left while the page is scrolled.
It’s divided into 4 use cases (top, bottom, left and right), depending on the direction where the shadow should be cast.
It's used for the App Bar, Side menu, Panel header, Rolling panel, Table header... etc.

## Activated (level 2)

This level is used for those actionable components that appear immediately after a specific interaction, and are usually
positioned next to its trigger. It's used in the popper blocks as Dropdown, Inline Message, Select menu, Calendar, Tooltip... etc.

## Draggable (level 3)

This level is used in those Panels and Windows that can be moved or repositioned across the screen. It's used in Draggable Window, Inline message draggable, etc.

## Overlay (level 4)

This level is used basically only in connection with Modals/Dialogs, which also has a background overlay with opacity.
It can also be used if we want to reinforce the 'hover' event in those panels/windows that are previously at the
'Draggable' level. It's used in Modal and Dialog.

for notifications. It's used in Toast message.
