# Content, voice and tone

Technical documentation should be concise and grammatically correct. It is written on a specific topic and is aimed at a specific reader. The main purpose of this document is to provide guidelines on how to make technical writing clear, concise, consistent and understandable for end users.

Those with a background in journalism will be familiar with the [Chicago style manual](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html).
This is an indispensable reference for all things grammar and syntax related, and
serves as our point of reference for all grammar-related pain points. However, it
isn't specific to the needs of technical writing so this document will include Devo-specific
style rules.

This guide covers the core principles of English writing, lists key grammar and punctuation rules, explains how to structure content to improve readability, and provides some useful pointers to make the process of technical writing easier.

It is aimed at all those who write or review texts in the interfaces of Devo products in the areas:

- Voice & Tone
- Language and grammar
- Glossary of action labels

## Voice & Tone

### 01. Introduction

<Row>
  <Col md={6} lg={7}>
    Devo's voice is how we communicate with users. When creating content it's
    important to consider not just what we say, but how we say it. Although our
    voice is consistent throughout all of our documentation, its tone adapts to
    each situation as well as the reader's expectations.
  </Col>
  <Col md={6} lg={5}>
    <Figure>
      <img
        alt="Location of the 'status' icon button in a widget header"
        src="img/Voice-tone-1.5x.png"
      />
    </Figure>
  </Col>
</Row>

Devo's voice is clear, informative, and relaxed. We use an informal style to write
content that is both simple and instructive. Check [this article](https://techwhirl.com/gender-neutral-technical-writing/)
for more information on keeping your writing and tone gender neutral.

| **Be concise (Less is more )** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; | Takes an existing object and uses it in a new context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Be human**                                                   | Even though this is technical documentation, avoid sounding like a robot. Read your text out loud and ask yourself if this is something a human would say. Also keep in mind that not all readers are experts on the given topic.<br/><em>Robotic: Invalid password.</em><br/><em>Human: Your password must contain a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.</em>                                        |
| **Be present**                                                 | Where possible, use the present tense and avoid using the past or future tense. This makes following procedures and instructions easier for readers and gives a sense of immediacy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Be direct<br/>/simple/clear**                                | This is not creative writing, but rather informative writing. Lead with important actions. The user wants to find information quickly. This allows the reader to scan the page for keywords.<br/>Most of the time, start each statement with a verb. Avoid using "you can" and "there is", "there are", "there were".                                                                                              |
| **Be inclusive**                                               | - Use the second-person pronoun (you, your, yours).<br/>- Do not use words that have gender-specific pairs (mankind, man hours).<br/>- Avoid phrases or words that could be misinterpreted or offend (blacklist/whitelist).<br/>- To avoid repetition it is acceptable to use the third-person pronoun they or replace he/she with the user.- Use the imperative mood (Do this, Close the window, Open a new tab). |

### 02. Abbreviations

Avoid using abbreviations where possible in your writing. This includes common abbreviations such as etc., e.g., and i.e. Instead, write out full words or choose phrases that explicitly explain the message you want to convey.

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      _**etc.**_

      _**e.g.**_

      _**i.e.**_
    </Figure>

  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**And so on**_

      _**For example**_

      _**Specifically or namely**_
    </Figure>

  </Col>
</Row>

### 03. Active and passive voice

Use the active voice to make your sentences direct and easy to read. The **active voice** conveys a strong and clear tone, while the **passive voice** is weaker.

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      _**A new password needs to be selected.**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**Select a new password.**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
</Row>

With the **active voice**, the subject of the sentence does the action. With the
**passive voice**, the subject of the sentence has the action done to it.

However, the **passive voice** is acceptable in the following situations:

- In an error message or troubleshooting content when the active subject is the user.
- The subject of the action is unknown, or you want to emphasize the object on which the action is performed.
- The sentence in active voice sounds unnatural or complicated.

### 04. Messaging guidelines

Write the error in clear, concise, and simple language. Avoid long sentences or ambiguous phrases.

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      _**An error has occurred during the login process and you cannot log in to
      your account, please try again.**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**Your password and/or username do not match. Please try again.**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
</Row>

Don’t blame the user.

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      _**You didn’t enter an email address.**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**Please enter an email address.**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
</Row>

Avoid negative words that undermine the user’s ability to follow instructions.

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      _** The username you have entered contains errors.**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**Please enter a valid username.**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
</Row>

Guide the user and offer suggestions to help resolve the issue.

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      _**Enter a new name.**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**A domain with this name already exists. Please enter a new name.**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
</Row>

Avoid using all caps or upper case. This gives the impression of shouting at
the user and is difficult to read.

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      _**AN ERROR HAS OCCURRED. PLEASE TRY AGAIN.**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**An error has occurred. Please try again.**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
</Row>

### 05. Modal verbs

Use modal verbs to express ideas such as ability, uncertainty, necessity and permission. Use modal verbs sparingly and
at your discretion, and always use the correct verb for the instruction.

Avoid the modal verbs _shall_, _might_, _would_, and _ought_ to in your writing.

Instead, you should use:

- _**Can:**_ Relates to present ability and general possibility.
- _**Could:**_ Relates to possibility and suggestion.
- _**May:**_ Relates to probability and permission. It also means that an
  item is optional.
- _**Need:**_ Relates to the absence of obligation. In technical
  documentation, this verb is used only as a synonym for the verb want.
- _**Must:**_ Relates to personal obligation. It means that the definition
  is an absolute requirement of the specification.
- _**Have to:**_ Relates to impersonal obligation. Don't use it as a synonym
  for the verb must.
- _**Should:**_ Relates to expectation and recommendation. Don't use it as a
  synonym for the verb must.

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      Example
    </Figure>
  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      Example
    </Figure>
  </Col>
</Row>

## Language and grammar

The core function of the language and grammar used in technical and UX writing is to inform, as opposed to arguing or entertaining. Therefore, your writing should focus on providing straightforward and instructional statements that users can easily understand.

<Row>
  <Col md={6} lg={7}>
    Your writing should be consistent and concise, so that the user can follow
    prompts and steps without hesitation. Since the topic is instructional and
    often requires focused attention, longer sentences can lead to a higher
    potential for confusion. Short explanations are easier to understand.
  </Col>
  <Col md={6} lg={5}>
    <Figure>
      <img
        alt="Location of the 'status' icon button in a widget header"
        src="img/illustration-1.png"
      />
    </Figure>
  </Col>
</Row>

The same process applies to writing UI labels or commands. Remove superfluous words
and keep a consistent grammatical style throughout.

### 01. Bold

Use bold text formatting for static interface elements: buttons, tabs, links, options, check boxes, step names, and so forth. Do not use quotation marks to refer to these elements.

<Figure>
  <img
    alt="Location of the 'status' icon button in a widget header"
    src="img/Bold-2x.png"
  />
</Figure>

### 02. Capitalization

**Use sentence case**. That means only capitalizing the first word of a sentence, heading, title, UI label, tab, or standalone phrase. Sentence case makes it easier to differentiate between common and proper nouns.

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      _**In Data Search, The Tabs Would Be Explore Your Data, Search History,
      Query Management, And Lookup Management.**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**In Data search, the tabs would be Explore your data, Search history,
      Query management, and Lookup management.**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
</Row>

Exceptions to the sentence case rule are products and trademarks, which are written according to their stylization.

Do not use all caps (all uppercase) as this makes it difficult for the reader to differentiate between common and proper nouns.

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      _**USE THE CREDENTIALS CREATED HERE TO AUTHENTICATE REST API REQUESTS AND
      DEVO RELAY CONNECTIONS TO THE DEVO PLATFORM.**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**Use the credentials created here to authenticate REST API requests and
      Devo Relay connections to the Devo Platform.**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
</Row>

When writing about a UI element, always follow the same capitalization as used in the UI. For example, if referring to the **“Data search”** window you would be correct to write: “To run a search, you must access the data table where the events you need to work with are stored. You can do this via the **Data search** area in the navigation panel.”

The above rule applies to all UI elements including input forms, drop-down menus, and action labels.

### 03. Currency

Write the names of currencies in lowercase, but capitalize the reference to the country or region.

<Row>
  <Col md={6} lg={7}>
    Write the names of currencies in lowercase, but capitalize the reference to the country or region.

    Note that the euro is not capitalized and do not make it plural.

  </Col>
  <Col md={6} lg={5}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**US dollar**_

      _**Canadian dollar**_

      _**British pound**_

      _**Japanese yen**_
    </Figure>

  </Col>
</Row>

<Row>
  <Col md={6} lg={7}>
    When referring to specific amounts of money in any currency, use the
    currency symbol on first reference followed by the amount with no spacing.
    Any further references use the currency symbol.
  </Col>
  <Col md={6} lg={5}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**USD450, then $450**_

      _**EUR100, then €100**_

      _**JPY250, then ¥250**_
    </Figure>

  </Col>
</Row>

### 04. Date & time

<Row>
  <Col md={6} lg={7}>
    Dates are written in the month–day–year order, with a comma before and
    after the year if it is not at the end of a sentence.

    When describing a length of time, use abbreviations.

    Time is written in 24-hour notation.

  </Col>
  <Col md={6} lg={5}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**March 24, 2021**_

      _**8h 30min.**_

      _**18:14**_
    </Figure>

  </Col>
</Row>

### 05. Gender

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    Use the **second-person pronoun** (you, your, yours) and avoid words that have gender pairs.
    Use the imperative mood and drop the pronoun whenever you can.
  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**"Choose a password and type it into the text box."**_

      _**"The user chooses a password and types it into the text box."**_
    </Figure>

  </Col>
</Row>

Replace gender-specific possessive pronouns with the:

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      _**"When the user types his password..."**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**"When the user types the password..."**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
</Row>

### 06. Italics

Use italic text formatting for selectable interface elements (drop-down list options, object types) and input data you
enter (object names, parameter names, parameter values, field values). Also, use italic formatting for error messages,
section names if referencing an external document, and state and status names.

### 07. Links / Hyperlinks

When cross-referencing or linking to another article, include the link in the descriptive text.

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      _**"Click here”**_

      _**"More information here”**_
    </Figure>

  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**"Read our documentation on LINQ queries"**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
</Row>

### 08. Lists and procedures

**Bullet lists** do not necessarily need to go in order. They are a collection of items that have something in common but whose order is interchangeable:

- Use a period after every bullet that is a sentence.
- Don’t use a period after bullet lists that are not complete sentences or do not complete the opening stem sentence.
- Do not use semicolons to end punctuation.
- Use either all full sentences in your bullet lists or all fragments.
- Capitalize the first letter in each bullet.
- End the stem sentence with a colon.

**Numbered lists** are used for steps or processes and must go in chronological order.

- Use a period after every bullet that is a sentence.
- Don’t use a period after bullet lists that are not complete sentences or do not complete the opening stem sentence.
- Do not use semicolons to end punctuation.
- Use either all full sentences in your bullet lists or all fragments.
- Capitalize the first letter in each bullet.
- End the stem sentence with a colon.

For UI writing, if creating a list which is a series of radio buttons or boxes, do not use punctuation unless the items in the list are complete sentences. For both UI and technical writing, keep lists to a maximum of 10 items whenever possible as this makes it easier for the reader to scan.

### 09. Monospaced text

Use courier text formatting for anything that can be copy and pasted into a command line: URL paths, folder names, file names, and so forth.

### 10. Numbers

Generally, one to nine are written as words. Anything larger than nine should be written as a numeral (10, 11, and so on). Use commas to separate thousand units: 1,000.

Exceptions to the above are:

- When starting a sentence avoid using numerals.
- In the same sentence as higher numbers.
- In headings, buttons, and wherever space is very limited (not subheadings).
- In version numbers, dates, and times.
- Abbreviated units of measurement.
- Percentages.

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      _**"The category length cant be more than six characters." **_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**"The category length cant be more than 6 characters."**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
</Row>

### 11. Plurals

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    To form the plural of an abbreviation, an acronym, or a number, add a lowercase s without an apostrophe. If an acronym already represents a plural noun, do not add an s.
  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">

      _**CPUs, APIs, IDs, OSs, the 1990s, 0s, and 1s**_

      _**FAQ: frequently asked questions**_
    </Figure>

  </Col>
</Row>

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    To form the plural of a single letter or a symbol, add an apostrophe and a lowercases.
  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**x’s, #’s**_
    </Figure>

  </Col>
</Row>

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    Abbreviated units of measure are both singular and plural; no s is necessary.
  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**5 mm, 20 min**_
    </Figure>

  </Col>
</Row>

Do not use (s), /s, (es), or /es at the end of a word to indicate the possibility
of more than one item, and do not combine the singular and plural forms of a verb,
such as is/are.

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      _**Close any application(s) that is/are open. **_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">

      _**Close any application that is open.**_

      _**Close any applications that are open.**_
    </Figure>

  </Col>
</Row>

### 12. Oxford comma

In a list of three or more items, include a comma before the conjunction.

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      _**Android, iOS and Windows**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**Android, iOS, and Windows**_
    </Figure>
  </Col>
</Row>

### 13. Possessives

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    To form the possessive case of nouns, add an apostrophe and an s, even if
    the noun ends in s, x, or z. To form the possessive of plural nouns that end
    in s, add only an apostrophe.
  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**the table's contents**_

      _**the box's contents**_

      _**users' accounts**_

      _**the Joneses' computer**_
    </Figure>

  </Col>
</Row>

### 14. Pronouns

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    Use the second person singular (you, your) whenever possible. This is a
    friendly and direct way to communicate with the user.

    Use the first person for tabs and sections that are specific to the user,
    such as **My account**, **My domains**, or **My data**.

    Avoid using gender-specific third-person pronouns (he, she).

  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**You must select your own domain or an external domain.**_

      **“My favorite searches”** in the Data Search.

      **“My cross-search charts”** in the Data Search.
    </Figure>

  </Col>
</Row>

### 15. Punctuation

Punctuation is used to structure and organize content. It provides the reader with vital clues to understand the meaning
of a text. Proper punctuation is also an important tool to make your written work logical and readable.
Even a small comma can greatly change the meaning of the sentence.

The more punctuation you add, the more complex a sentence becomes. If a sentence contains more than two commas and
ending punctuation, consider rewriting it.

#### Apostrophes

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    To form the possessive case of nouns. Add an apostrophe and an s, even if
    the noun ends in s, x, or z. To form the possessive of plural nouns that end
    in s, add only an apostrophe.

    To indicate a missing letter in a contraction.

  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      _**the table's contents**_

      _**the box's contents**_

      _**users' accounts**_

      _**the Joneses' computer**_

      _**won't**_

      _**don't**_

      _**it's**_
    </Figure>

  </Col>
</Row>

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    Don’t use an apostrophe:

    - For the possessive form of it.
    - With a possessive pronoun.
    - To form the plural of a singular noun.

  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      _**The cat ate it's food**_

      _**Mine's different**_

      _**All the cat's**_
    </Figure>

  </Col>
</Row>

#### Colons and semicolons

##### Colons

A colon provides an explanation to the information you have just mentioned. A semicolon indicates a brief pause that is slightly longer than that of a comma.

Use a colon:

- At the end of a sentence that directly introduces a list.
- Sparingly at the end of a statement followed by a second statement that expands on it. Most of the time, two sentences are easier to read.

When you use a colon in a sentence, lowercase the word that follows it unless:

- The colon introduces a direct quotation.
- The first word after the colon is a proper noun.

When you use a colon in a title or heading, capitalize the word that directly follows it.

##### Semicolons

Sentences that contain semicolons are often difficult to read. Try to simplify the sentence by breaking it into multiple sentences or a list.

Use semicolons:

- Between two independent clauses that are not joined
  by a conjunction.
- Between contrasting statements that are not joined by a
  conjunction.
- To separate items in a series that contains commas or other
  punctuation. In this case it is usually better to break it down into a list as
  it scans better.

#### Commas

While a period ends a sentence, a comma indicates a brief pause.

**Use a comma:**

- Before the conjunction in a list of three or more items. This is known as the Oxford Comma.
- Following an introductory phrase.
- In a series of two or more adjectives that precede a noun when their order is interchangeable.
- To separate conjunctive adverbs (in addition, also, on the other hand, however, moreover, furthermore, for example, finally).

Here is a full list of conjunctive adverbs:

**Don’t use a comma:**

- To join independent clauses when you do not use a conjunction. Use a semicolon instead.
- Between two verbs that apply to the same subject.
- Between the month and the year when a specific date is not mentioned.

#### Contractions

Contractions convey a warm and friendly tone, but they can be confusing for non-native readers. For this reason
it is best to avoid them. A contraction indicates that one word should be written as two words.

#### Dashes and hyphens

Dashes and hyphens are not interchangeable. Keep the following in mind:

- Em dashes (—) set off or emphasize parenthetical phrases.
- En dashes (–) are used in number and date ranges, in negative numbers, and as a minus sign.
- Hyphens (-) are used to join words and connect prefixes to stem words. Do not use two hyphens in place of an em dash.

Do not use spaces before or after em and en dashes.

#### Ellipses

Avoid using an ellipsis (…) except to indicate omitted code in technical content.

#### Exclamation points/marks

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    Exclamation points should not be used. In the unusual case of it being
    appropriate to use one, never end a sentence with more than one exclamation
    point.
  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">

      _**Does that apply to question marks, too?????**_

      _**Yes!!!!!!!**_
    </Figure>

  </Col>
</Row>

#### Periods (full stops)

Do not use periods in headings, subheadings, UI titles, UI text, or simple lists (three or fewer words per item).

End all sentences with a period. Put one space after a period.

When a phrase ending with a colon introduces a bulleted list:

- If one or more list elements complete the introductory phrase preceding the colon, use a period after every list element.
- If all list elements are short phrases (three words or fewer), do not end them with periods, even if they form a complete sentence together with the list introduction.
- If one or more list elements are complete sentences, use a period after every element, even if a list element contains three or fewer words.

#### Question marks

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    The reader is looking for an answer, not a question, so use them sparingly.

    However, it is acceptable to use a question mark when the user needs to make a decision.

      _**Do you want to save your changes?**_

      _**Do you want to shut down the system?**_
    </Figure>

  </Col>
</Row>

#### Quotation marks

Limit the use of quotations to direct quotes as they give a busy look to the text. When necessary, use double quotation marks (" ") instead of single quotation marks (' ').

Place closing quotation marks:

- Outside commas and periods.
- Inside other punctuation.

#### Slashes

When you instruct users to enter a slash, include the spelled-out term first, followed by the symbol in parentheses.

Use a slash for combinations. Capitalize the word after the slash if the word before the slash is capitalized. In the case of in-app features or parts, capitalize both.

Don't use a slash as a substitute for or. If the UI uses a slash in this way, follow the interface in describing the label, but use or to describe the action in writing.

### 16. Titles and headings

Headings allow readers to easily scan content by offering structure and reference points. It is important that headings
are used consistently; it usually suffices to have one or two heading levels in any given article.

- Keep headings as short as possible, and lead in with the most important idea.
- Be as specific as possible, becoming even more detailed with lower-level headings.
- Focus on what users can achieve or what they need to know about a feature.

<Row>
  <Col sm={6}>
    Use noun phrases for first-level headings, verb phrases for second-level
    headings, and infinitive phrases for headings in instructions.

    Use sentence-style capitalization for headings. That means that you capitalize the first word, any proper nouns,
    and the first word after a colon (if there is one).

    Don't end headings with a period. Use your own judgement if a question
    mark is needed in certain cases. If there are more punctuation as Commas in the heading, then it's correct ending
    with a period.

  </Col>
  <Col sm={6}>

      _**The correct usage of alerts, reports and dashboards.**_

    </Figure>

  </Col>
</Row>

Use italic if it would be required in body text.

- Keep hyphenated words and multiple-word proper nouns on the same line.
- If a heading is longer than two lines, consider rewriting it.
- Do not use ampersands (&) or plus signs (+) in headings unless you're referring to UI that contains them or space is limited.
- Avoid hyphens in headings if possible.

### 17. US English (Spelling)

Use American English for all documentation. Run an American English spellcheck if you're unsure.

## Glossary of action labels

<Row>
  <Col md={6}>
    Using the right words for action labels is important if you want to make your product user-friendly.
    Consistent and precise labelling gives users clarity and motivation to take the right action.

    Action labels are the middlemen between your product and its users, any
    confusion or hesitation could lead to dissatisfaction on the users’ behalf,
    which in turn could lead to frustration and poor user experience.

  </Col>
  <Col md={6}>

  </Col>
</Row>

Here are some tips to keep in mind when creating top-notch action labels:

**1. Call to action.**

Action labels should always inspire users to do just that: take action. When users read an action verb, they know what the button will do. The user can perform the action without needing to read the dialog box or any supporting text. Action buttons such as ‘Yes/No’ are vague and force users to read more to understand the result of their actions.

**2. Be concise.**

Use the imperative form in an active voice. This reduces the number of words and makes the action label easier to scan. Words like ‘a’ and ‘the’ aren’t necessary for the user to complete an action, so remove them from your labels.

**3. Use language that lets the user know the end result of the action.**

Vague or generic action labels can cause uncertainty for users because they aren’t sure what the result of the action will be. If users are unsure of the result of clicking on an action label, there is a chance they will make errors, leading to user dissatisfaction.

| **Clear**                         | This action clears all the fields or selections. Where appropriate, combine Clear with the object (Clear fields or Clear all).                                                                                         |

| **Edit**                          | Allows data or values to be modified. Edit does not always imply the object is automatically updated, the user usually has to save the changes.                                                                        |

| **New**                           | Starts the creation of a new object. New either creates the object immediately or opens a dialog or set of fields where the user can enter properties. Combine New with the object to create (New user or New column). |
| **Refresh**                       | Reloads the view of an object when the displayed view has become unsynchronized with the source.                                                                                                                       |

| **Reset**                         | Reverts values back to their last saved state. The last saved state includes the values stored the last time the user clicked Apply.                                                                                   |
| **Run**                           | Initiates a procedure.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
