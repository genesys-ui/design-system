# Iconography

Icons are visual symbols used to represent concepts, objects, actions, processes... etc. They allow a quick communication and draw attention to specific information.

We use an Icon Library called [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/) as base. When we
canâ€™t find there an icon which covers our needs, then we have to create a new one,
but using as base an existing icon from the library with the same aspect ratio.

We can apply a very wide range of colours to our icons depending on their parent components, context, status... etc. but we should use always a size included in this limited range:
