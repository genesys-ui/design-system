# Empty states

Empty states appear when there is no data to display in a particular area of the interface. 
They play a crucial role in providing clarity, guiding users, and preventing confusion when 
a view cannot show its usual content.

An empty state should:

- Explain what is happening
- Help users understand why there is no content
- Provide a clear path forward when relevant such as adding new content or refreshing data. 

## Types of empty states

### First-time use

    src="img/empty-status-1x.jpg"
  />
</Figure>

Shown when users access a feature for the first time and haven't created or added any content yet.
The purpose is to introduce the feature, set expectations and encourage users to take their first action.

### No results

    src="img/pattern-empty-no-results.png"
  />
</Figure>

Displayed when a search or filtered view returns no matches. It should inform users that 
no results were found  and suggest ways to modify their search or filters to find 
relevant content. 

In this case, the format is extremely simple, usually just a text message 
without any additional graphics, because the user has already interacted with the system, 
and the context usually has not enough space to show more information.

### Errors

Shown when a technical problem prevents data from being loaded. It should inform users about 
the issue and provide options to retry, seek help, or report the problem.

## Content guidelines

### Tone

Be clear, concise, and supportive, without unnecessary technical jargon. Obviously, 
avoid blaming the user and keep the message actionable.

### Structure

A good empty state usually includes:

- **A short title**: what's happening.
- **A brief description**: why or what it means.
- **A recommended action**: what the user can do next.

## Visual guidelines

### Iconography

- Use simple, meaningful icons.
- Avoid overly decorative illustrations.
- Maintain consistent sizing and style across the system.

### Layout

- Provide generous spacing to reduce visual clutter.
- Center or align according to your design system's patterns.
- Keep content in a compact group (title, description, action).

### Colors

- Use neutral colors for default empty states.
- Only use critical colors (such as red) for true system errors.
- Ensure accessibility contrast levels.

### Actions

- Use a primary CTA only when a direct next step is available.
- Use secondary CTAs or links when actions are optional.
- Avoid offering multiple competing options.

## Interaction guidelines

- Empty states should update automatically when content becomes available.
- Retry actions should provide immediate feedback.
- Keep transitions smooth and avoid abrupt changes.

## Accessibility guidelines

- Provide alternative text for icons and visuals.
- Ensure readable contrast ratios.
- Do not rely only on color to communicate meaning.
- Keep the reading order logical for screen readers.

## Code usage

To create empty states you should use the `EmptyState` or `StatusMessage` component from Genesys UI. 
The second one is used for the 'error type' emoty state. 
If you need some help using it, [read the docs](https://devoinc.github.io/genesys-ui/?path=/docs/getting-started-installation--overview).
