# Loading states

We may encounter different situations in which the page we are on, a component, 
or a specific area can enter a loading state while data is being returned or 
changes are being made in the database.

In each particular case, the user will be informed that this is happening, 
and at the same time they will be prevented from interacting with the elements 
involved in the loading state.

## Page

If the element entering the loading state is the entire page, a semi-transparent 
overlay layer will be used with the 'brand' type loading symbol:

{/*<img src='img/pattern-loading-page.jpg' alt='Page Loading behavior example'/>*/}

<video controls>
  <source src="video/pattern-loading-page.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <img
    src="img/pattern-loading-page.jpg"
    alt="Page Loading behavior example"
    title="Your brwser doesn't support HTML5 video"
  />
</video>

## Area or container

For this case, a semi-transparent overlay layer will also be used, but with a white-colored 
background and using the 'spinner' type loading symbol:

{/*<img src='img/pattern-loading-container.jpg' alt='Container Loading behavior example'/>*/}

<video controls>
  <source src="video/pattern-loading-container.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <img
    src="img/pattern-loading-container.jpg"
    alt="Container Loading behavior example"
    title="Your brwser doesn't support HTML5 video"
  />
</video>

## Interactive elements

When the element entering the loading state is a button, chip, etc., while 
its associated action is being executed, the button will no longer allow 
clicking and the cursor will change to not-allowed. In addition, its content 
will be modified depending on its type and associated action. The loading 
state also implies the blocked state.

### Icon only

Cuando el button sólo tenga como contenido un icono, mientras dure el 'loading
state', se sustituirá por el svg animado tipo 'spinner'.

When the button's only content is an icon, during the loading state, it will be
replaced with the animated spinner-type SVG.

<Canvas of={Stories.IconButtonLoading} />

### Text only

The SVG with the animated spinner will always be added to the left of the text. 
The text will be replaced with the action being performed plus ellipsis. 
Whenever possible, the button's previous width will be preserved.

<Canvas of={Stories.ButtonTextLoading} />

### Text & icon

In this case, the icon is replaced with the SVG containing the animated spinner. 
The text will be replaced with the action being performed plus ellipsis. 
Whenever possible, the butto's previous width will be preserved.

<Canvas of={Stories.ButtonIconTextLoading} />
