# Common actions
Common actions appear frequently in different components and workflows. These actions should be applied as follows:

## Add
Add inserts an existing object into a list or system. 

Example:
<Figure>
  <img
    alt="Location of the 'status' icon button in a widget header"
    src="img/component-button-location-neutral-01.png"
  />
</Figure>

## Edit
Edit allows you to modify data in the user interface. Editing usually results in a change to the target or input element.

Example:
<Figure>
  <img
    alt="Location of the 'status' icon button in a widget header"
    src="img/edit-pattern-2x.jpg"
  />
</Figure>

## Cancel
Cancel stops the action being performed and closes the component or element. We must warn the user of the consequences if the process does not proceed, such as loss of data for exampl

Example:
<Figure>
  <img
    alt="Location of the 'status' icon button in a widget header"
    src="img/cancel-pattern-2x.jpg"
  />
</Figure>

## Delete
Delete destroys an object. Delete actions cannot be undone easily and are usually permanent. We must warn the user of the negative consequences of destroying an object, such as loss of data. 

Example:
<Figure>
  <img
    alt="Location of the 'status' icon button in a widget header"
    src="img/edit-pattern-2x.jpg"
  />
</Figure>
