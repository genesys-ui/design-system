<h1 class="sbdocs sbdocs-h1">Design principles</h1>

The Genesys Design System is built upon a set of core design principles 
that guide our approach to creating user experiences. These principles 
ensure that our designs are user-centric, accessible, and consistent 
across all products and platforms.

    Modularity ensures that every component is reusable, composable, and adaptable to various scenarios. 
    By designing self-contained building blocks, teams can assemble complex interfaces efficiently and consistently. 
    This approach improves scalability, simplifies maintenance, and supports the product's growth without 
    introducing fragmentation or duplicated effort.

    Consistency ensures uniform patterns, tokens, and behaviors throughout the entire system, 
    making interfaces predictable and intuitive. By standardizing visual and interaction rules, 
    teams work faster and users learn more easily. Consistency reinforces the system's identity, 
    reduces friction, and creates stable, cohesive experiences across all products and platforms.

    <div class="sbdocs sbdocs-h2">Clarity</div>

    Clarity ensures that information is presented in a direct, structured, and easily digestible way, 
    minimizing visual noise and emphasizing hierarchy. By guiding attention through deliberate spacing, 
    typography, and layout, it helps users process large amounts of data with minimal effort. 
    Clear, purposeful design reduces cognitive load and enables users to understand content 
    and take action quickly and confidently.

    <div class="sbdocs sbdocs-h2">Open</div>

    </Figure>
    Openness emphasizes accessibility, transparency, and collaboration, making the system 
    easy to adopt and contribute to. Clear documentation, inclusive design practices, 
    and transparent decision-making strengthen trust and usability. 
    By encouraging participation and offering flexible, well-explained components, 
    an open system evolves organically with the needs of its community.
