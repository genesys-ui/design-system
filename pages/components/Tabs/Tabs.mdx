## Accessibility

### Tabs

Recommended attributes to be included:

#### aria-label

The [aria-label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label)
attribute defines a string value that labels an interactive element, in this
case, provides a label that describes the purpose of the set of tabs.

#### role="tablist"

The [tablist role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/tablist_role)
identifies the element that serves as the container for a set of tabs. The tab
content are referred to as tabpanel elements.

### TabsItem

Recommended attributes to be included:

#### aria-selected

In a tablist, [aria-selected](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-selected#tab)
is used on a tab to indicate the currently-displayed tabpanel.

The selected tab in a tablist should have has its aria-selected="true" set. All
inactive tabs in the tablist should have aria-selected="false" set. Setting the
state only impacts the accessibility tree: make sure to style the active tab in
a way that visual indicates it's selected state. The default value for
aria-selected on a tab role is false.

#### aria-controls

The global [aria-controls](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-controls)
property identifies the element (or elements) whose contents or presence are
controlled by the element on which this attribute is set.

#### tabindex

The [tabindex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex)
global attribute indicates that its element can be focused, and where it
participates in sequential keyboard navigation (usually with the Tab key, hence
the name).

A negative value (usually tabindex="-1") means that the element is not reachable
via sequential keyboard navigation, but could be focused with JavaScript or
visually by clicking with the mouse. It's mostly useful to create accessible
widgets with JavaScript.

**Is strongly recommended to set the `tabindex="-1"` attribute for disabled
TabsItem.**

#### role="tab"

The [ARIA tab role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/tab_role)
indicates an interactive element inside a tablist that, when activated, displays
its associated tabpanel.

#### aria-hidden (icon)

The icon element must have the `aria-hidden` attribute to hide for assistive
technologies due is only decorative.

#### aria-label and title (button)

The IconButton has no text content, so we need to use the `aria-label` attribute
to inform about what the button does to assistive technologies. Is recommend
adding a `title` attribute to inform the users by hovering with the mouse.
