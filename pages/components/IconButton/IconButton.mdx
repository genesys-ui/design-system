# Icon button

IconButtons allow users to take minor actions and make choices, with a single tap

## Overview

### Variants

Each button variant has a particular function and its design signals that function to the user. It is therefore very
important that the different variants are implemented consistently across products,
so that they message the correct actions.

| **Accent**                                                           | 3        | This is the second most emphasized action. This variant is barely used. In some cases it's used to draw to temporarily draw attention to an action.                |

### Emphasis

<Figure spaceToTop>
  <Figma url="https://www.figma.com/file/4f9wa0fKYIwMue6yo6nrJL/Genesys---Doc---assets?type=design&node-id=1445%3A5200&mode=design&t=w2L6EPXjlqcjNbrV-1" />
</Figure>

The emphasis variants as 'accent-high' and 'accent' are barely used, because the actions bounded to the IconButtons
usually are less important. There are some contexts where they are used, mainly to temporarily draw attention to an
action.

Therefore, the more used are the neutral variants as secondary actions in toolbars, widgets,
navigation blocks... etc. They are typically also used for choice groups where each one acts as a radio or checkbox.

Some cases as `IconButtonStatus` are used to show/hide contextual floating helpers or status messages. There are also
cases as `IconButtonCollapse` or `IconButtonClose` which are highly specialized in a single action.

A medium-emphasis button can be accompanied by low-emphasis icon buttons that perform less important actions (but related).
Keep in mind that you should only group together actions when they are related.

When we have a group of icon buttons, we have always to order them from right to left based in the emphasis
of the button, so the more emphasis it has, more to the right in the group it's located.

### Location

It depends usually on the emphasis and the importance of the button. More emphasis you want, more prominent location will
need the button.

#### Accent high and accent

As we said, the emphasis variants as 'accent-high' and 'accent' are barely used, but there are some contexts where
they are used, mainly to temporarily draw attention to an action or choice.

<Figure caption="Contextual location of an 'accent-high' icon button in the real time choice to draw attention to this.">
  <img
    alt="Contextual location of an 'accent-high' icon button."
    src="img/component-icon-button-location-accent.png"
  />
</Figure>

#### Status

The 'status' buttons (error, success... etc.) are located in the same place of the 'neutral' ones, but when there
is a status context. This variant is not widely used, but a possible case would be a destructive action such as 'Delete'
or 'Remove'.

<Figure caption="Location of the 'status' icon button in a widget header">
  <img
    alt="Location of the 'status' icon button in a widget header"
    src="img/component-icon-button-location-status.png"
  />
</Figure>

#### Neutral and blend

The 'neutral' buttons are located as secondary actions in contexts as toolbars, widget and modal headers, filters,
combined fields... etc. The 'blend' buttons are located in the same place as the 'neutral' ones, but when they are over
coloured backgrounds.

<Figure caption="Location of a 'neutral' button in a editable list.">

    alt="Location of the 'neutral' button as secondary action in pair with an 'accent' one"
    src="img/component-button-location-neutral-03.png"
  />
</Figure>

#### Quiet

The 'quiet' buttons are located as secondary actions in pair with a more emphasis one which acts as the primary.
Usually in reduced and/or boxed contexts as Modals, Panels, Toasts, Banners, Poppers... etc.

Sometimes they are used instead of a neutral button, because of design reasons, such as when there are no other
prominent elements in a page or context, so the 'neutral' variant would be too much eye-catching.

## Anatomy

The Button can be composed by four elements and three ones at the same time:

- **Container**: This element manages sizing and spacing between these elements.
- **Content**: the content element (usually a text).
- **Icon**: to the left or to the right of the content.
- **Spinner loader**: the loading symbol which replaces the icon in that cases in which there is or is added to the left.

</Figure>

### Sizes

We're using usually the 'md' size for our buttons, but in some circumstances or contexts we need to use some variants
because of space and design reasons.

| Size &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **sm**                           | When we are including buttons in small toolbars inside Modals or Panels and the space is not enough to insert them or the remaining space breaks the white space balance. Also when they are combined with form controls with 'sm' size. |
| **md**                           | This is the default size and the most common.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **lg**                           | The expressive size. It is barely used in the App context, only in large or commercial contexts.                                                                                                                                         |

### States

The button has different states depending on the interaction with the user, with other blocks of the page or with
processes of which he is the trigger.

- **Hovered**: when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it.
  It is generally triggered when the user hovers over an element with the cursor (mouse pointer). Sometimes we can use
  this state to highlight an action over other ones. The styles bound to this state are equivalent to pseudo-class
  `:hover` ones.
- **Focused**: when the button has received focus. It is generally triggered when the user clicks or taps on an element
  or selects it with the keyboard's Tab key. The styles bound to this state are equivalent to pseudo-class
  `:focus` or `:focus-visible` ones.
- **Pressed**: when the button is being activated by the user. When using a mouse, "activation" typically starts when
  the user presses down the primary mouse button. The styles bound to this state are equivalent to pseudo-class
  `:active` ones.
- **Expanded**: to indicate if a button is expanded or collapsed, and whether the controlled elements by the button
  are displayed or hidden. This state should be accompanied of `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` attributes.
- **Selected**: this state is used to indicate which buttons within multi-selection composite widgets are selected.
  This state should be accompanied of `aria-selected` attribute. With this state the HTML tag rendered should not be
  a `button` but a `label`, because a checkbox should be rendered inside, but not visible. Other alternative is to
  use the role `checkbox` accompanied of the attributes `aria-checked` and `tabindex`.
- **Activated**: this state is used to indicate which button within single-selection composite widgets is selected.
  This state should be accompanied of `aria-selected` attribute. With this state the HTML tag rendered should not
  be a `button` but a `label`, because a radio should be rendered inside, but not visible. Other alternative is to
  use the role `radio` accompanied of the attributes `aria-checked` and `tabindex`.
- **Disabled**: this state is used to indicate the button is disabled, so no action or operation is available for
  the button. We should add the `disabled` attribute. However, there can be instances where elements need to be exposed
  as disabled, but are still available for users to find when navigating via the Tab key. In these cases we should use
  the `aria-disabled` attribute, but it's important to block any action bounded to the button, because this aria
  attribute does not have the native behavior of the `disabled` one.
- **Loading**: this state is used when the process or the action triggered by the button is not immediate,
  and it's still running. To denote this context we add a spinner loader to the left of the text; we modify the text of
  the button to transmit the state of the process, and we add ellipsis points to its end. E.g. from 'Save changes' to
  'Saving changes...'. In addition, we add a spinner loader to the left of the text.
- **Loading error**: this state is used when the process or the action triggered by the button is not immediate,
  and it's finished with errors. To denote this context we add an error icon to the left of the text, and we replace
  temporary the text of the button with the error message of the process. This state is not permanent, because after a
  few moments the button has to return to its default state. In addition, to get to this state, we always need
  previously a 'loading' state in the button.
- **Loading success**: this state is used when the process or the action triggered by the button is not immediate,
  and it's finished successfully. To denote this context we add a success icon to the left of the text, and we replace
  temporary the text of the button with the success message of the process. This state is not permanent, because after a
  few moments the button has to return to its default state. In addition, to get to this state, we always need
  previously a 'loading' state in the button.

### Alignment

Alignment refers to whether the buttons are aligned to the right or the left of a window, container, or layout.

In general, on full-page designs or not contained forms, the buttons are on the left side of the page.

<Figure caption="Buttons in a form and in a full page layout aligned to the left.">
  <img
    alt="Buttons aligned to the left"
    src="img/component-button-align-left.png"
  />
</Figure>

Whereas we use right-alignment if the button is inside a boxed or highlighted context.
Typical nested button contexts are:

- Panels.
- Modals and Dialogs.
- Wizards.
- Toolbars.
- Headers.
- Footers.
- Notifications.
- Poppers.

<Figure caption="Buttons in a Modal footer (boxed and highlighted context) aligned to the right.">
  <img
    alt="Buttons aligned to the right"
    src="img/component-button-align-right.png"
  />
</Figure>

### Content

The text content of the button must indicate which is the triggered action. We have several recommendations defined for
the button texts:

- The text must be **clear and predictable**. Keep it simple. The text has to be precise and explain as much as possible
  with the minimum of words.
- We use **capitalization**: writing the text with its first letter as a capital letter (uppercase letter) and the remaining
  letters in lower case. E.g. 'Save changes', 'Add new entity'... etc.
- It's recommended to **use verbs**, specially in some cases is useful to add also a noun at the end to clarify to the user
  which is the triggered action. There are some exceptions as the most common actions as 'Close', 'Cancel', 'Add'... etc.
  or the stepper buttons whose texts usually are simply 'Back', 'Next', 'Last'... etc.
- **Personalize**: using the words âYouâ, âYourâ, âMeâ or âMyâ creates a sense of ownership.
- Maintain the **consistency** along the App: number of words, structure, capitalize... etc.

## Accessibility

### Disabled

We should add the `disabled` attribute. However, there can be instances where elements need to be exposed
as disabled, but are still available for users to find when navigating via the Tab key. In these cases we should use
the `aria-disabled` attribute, but it's important to block any action bounded to the button, because this aria
attribute does not have the native behavior of the `disabled` one.

<Source
  code={`
<button type="button" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Refresh the table" title="Refresh the table" class="icon-button icon-button--accent icon-button--disabled">
    <i class="icon-button__icon gi-reload_refresh_update" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</button>
`}
/>

<Source
  code={`

    <i class="icon-button__icon gi-reload_refresh_update" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</button>
`}
/>

### Selected

When the buttons within multi-selection composite widgets are selected. This state should be accompanied of
`aria-selected` attribute. With this state the HTML tag rendered should not be a `button` but a `label`,
because a checkbox should be rendered inside, but not visible. Other alternative is to use the role `checkbox`
accompanied of the attributes `aria-checked` and `tabindex`.

<Source
  code={`
<label class="icon-button icon-button--selected">
    <input type="checkbox" class="sr-only" aria-labelledby="button-text"/>
    <i class="icon-button__icon gi-reload_refresh_update" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</label>
`}
/>

<Source
  code={`
<span class="icon-button icon-button--selected" role="checkbox" aria-checked="false" tabindex="0">
    <i class="icon-button__icon gi-reload_refresh_update" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</span>
`}
/>

### Activated

When the button within single-selection composite widgets is selected. This state should be accompanied of
`aria-selected` attribute. With this state the HTML tag rendered should not be a `button` but a `label`, because
a radio should be rendered inside, but not visible. Other alternative is to use the role `radio` accompanied of
the attributes `aria-checked` and `tabindex`.

<Source
  code={`
<fieldset>
    <legend>What is your favourite color?</legend>
    <label class="icon-button icon-button--activated">
        <input checked type="radio" value="blue" name="button-radio" class="sr-only" aria-labelledby="button-text-01"/>

        <i class="icon-button__icon gi-reload_refresh_update" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </span>
</div>
`}
/>

### aria-hidden icon

The icon element must have the `aria-hidden` attribute to hide it to the assistive
technologies, because it's only a purely decorative content.

<Source
  code={`
<button class="icon-button" aria-label="Reload the table" title="Reload the table">
  <i class="icon-button__icon gi-reload_refresh_update" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</button>

### Hidden content, aria-label and title

The Icon Button has no text content, so we need to use the `aria-label` attribute to inform about what the button does
to assistive technologies. Another option is to include the text as content of the button, but with the `sr-only` class.
This class adds styles to hide the content, but maintaining it accessible for assistive technologies.
Also, we recommend adding a `title` attribute (or tooltip based in JS) to inform the users
by hovering with the mouse.

<Source
  code={`
<button class="icon-button" aria-label="Reload the table" title="Reload the table">
  <i class="icon-button__icon gi-reload_refresh_update" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</button>
`}
/>

<Source
  code={`
<button class="icon-button" title="Reload the table">
  <i class="icon-button__icon gi-reload_refresh_update" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  <span class="sr-only">Reload the table</span>
</button>
`}
/>

### Control

The `aria-haspopup` attribute indicates the availability and type of interactive popup element that can be triggered by
the button on which the attribute is set. E.g. when the button triggers a Modal.

The `aria-controls` attribute identifies the element (or elements) whose contents or presence are controlled by the
button on which this attribute is set. E.g. if the button opens a Modal, this attribute should be the `id` attribute
of the Modal container.

<Source
  code={`
<button class="icon-button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-controls="content-id">
  <i class="icon-button__icon gi-reload_refresh_update" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</button>
`}
/>

### Expanded

The `aria-expanded` attribute is set on the button to indicate if a control is expanded or collapsed, and whether
its child or controlled elements are displayed or hidden.

<Source
  code={`
<button class="icon-button" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="content-id">
  <i class="icon-button__icon gi-reload_refresh_update" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</button>
`}
/>

## Design tokens

### Size, space and typographic design tokens

Some of the tokens are based in the size of the button.
There are three pre-defined sizes: `sm`, `md` and `lg`.

### Color design tokens

The color tokens are based in the color scheme and the state of the button. So each token usually is a combination of a
color scheme and state (except the backdrop tokens).

There are several pre-defined color schemes: `accent-hight`, `accent`, `neutral`, `blend-base`, `blend-inverse`, `quiet`,
`error`, `success`, `warning`, `help` and `info`.

There are several pre-defined states: `enabled`, `hovered`, `focused`, `pressed`, `expanded`, `selected`, `activated`
`loading`, `loading-error`, `loading-success` and `disabled`.

### Complete list

The most of the IconButton tokens are the same as the Button component, but there are several ones
to apply specific styles to its cases: IconButtonStop, IconButtonDropdown... etc.
