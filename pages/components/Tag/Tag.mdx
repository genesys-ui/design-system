# Tag

Tags are informative elements presented with a keyword or phrase that allows the user to quickly know the status of the elements marked with it.

Each element may contain one or more tags depending on its data nature or classification system applied.

## Overview

Multiple or single tags can be used to categorize items. Each element may contain one or more tags depending on its data nature or classification system applied.

### Variants

The Tag components can be single or a list of items, in a single row or several of the with of the space reserved for a list of tags don´t allow a single line.

- **Size**: Four options: ‘lg’, ‘md’, ‘sm’, and ‘xs’.
- **ColorScheme**: with all the schemes available: Brand, UI and Visualzation
- **Content**: with three options: ‘label’, ‘icon + label’ and ‘quiet’
- **State**: Error, warning, success, help, info...

There isn't a 'quiet' version without icon; then, don't hide the icon when you use this variant.

## Anatomy

A Tag Component is quite simple component composed by an icon and a text wrapped in a colored box.

1. **Container**: This element manages sizing and spacing.
2. **Label**: Label.
3. **Icon**: Icon.

The main difference is on the ‘quite’ version. It hasn't background (but it still reseving the same space around) and it uses the component ‘Badge’ to for the side icon.

There is a spacing size that doesn't fit the standard rules.
The ‘lg’ and ‘md’ ‘icon + label’ options use 6px to improve the visual weight of the icon.

## Accessibility

### aria-label

We can use the `aria-label` attribute to inform about what the Tag is categorizing or grouping
to assistive technologies as screen readers.

<Source
  code={`
  <span class="tag" aria-label="Category of the article: Design tokens">
    Design tokens
  </span>
  `}
/>
