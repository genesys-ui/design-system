# Badge

The Badge component is used to highlight an information relevant for the user or to just draw attention in a specific element. Content within the badge usually are numbers or icons.

## Overview

The Badge Component used to display a small piece of information, either as icon or text. It should be always appended to other components like Buttons, Actions, or Labels. In the case of Buttons and Actions, the Badge is located in the upper right corner, putting the center of the Badge in the main component vertice. In the case of isolates texts like Labels or Links Components, the Badge will be appended on the left aligned with the vertical center.

Badges always should have an icon or a number, occasionally could have one or two letters, for example for the user initials. The unique exception that allows an empty Badge is to put the focus on a button for a miscellaneous reason not measurable.

### Variants

- **Size**: This must match the component it accompanies: sm. md and lg.
