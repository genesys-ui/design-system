# App bar

The App Bar provides users with quick access to the most important actions, navigation items, 
and contextual information within an application. It helps orient users, supports task efficiency, 
and ensures a consistent entry point across all product experiences.

## Overview

/>

The App Bar is a persistent interface element that anchors section name, key actions and global navigation 
at the top of the screen. It adapts to different layouts and device sizes, ensuring clear hierarchy 
and predictable behavior across the product ecosystem.

Designed to be flexible yet consistent, the App Bar can display a combination of elements—such 
as branding, page titles, search, user actions, or system status indicators—depending on the needs of each experience.

Use the App Bar to reinforce structure, improve discoverability, and provide users with a reliable 
starting point for interacting with your application.


### Anatomy

The App Bar is composed by three areas:

- On the left is the main page/section name.
- The next area o the left, separated with a divider, is the main navigation with the subsections of the page.
- On the right of the App Bar there are some main actions and the user options separated with another divider.

### Variants

The App Bar has four variants to accommodate different use cases:

- Compact: if the component has a lower height or not.
- Bordered: if the component has a border-bottom or not.

## Accessibility

### Keyboard navigation

The App Bar must be fully operable using a keyboard.
- All interactive elements (menu triggers, search fields, buttons, profile actions, etc.) must be included in a logical tab order.
- Use clear focus indicators that meet the minimum contrast ratio and remain visible against all App Bar backgrounds.
- Avoid trapping focus inside menus or overlays triggered from the App Bar.

### Screen reader support

The App Bar content must be accessible for screen readers.
- Provide descriptive labels (aria-label, aria-labelledby, or accessible names) for all controls and actions, especially when displayed without text.
- Use nav landmarks or appropriate roles to communicate the App Bar as a primary navigation region.
- Expandable sections or menus must announce their state (expanded/collapsed) to assistive technologies.

### Focus management

When triggering a menu, search field, or other overlay from the App Bar:
- Move focus into the opened element.
- Return focus to the trigger when it closes.
- Avoid auto-focus on page load unless explicitly required.
